          <p class="light">Our innovative solution uses tech to expand and deliver privilege where it’s needed most&mdash;and everyone wins! White men earn “Savior Stars” for providing free expert advice and mentoring from their unique perspective as long-standing privilege holders. </p>
          <p class="light">Non-whites access white privilege and use white advice, knowledge and skills to their advantage. They earn “Savee Stars” based on the worthiness of their problems and their work and motivation to resolve them.</p>
          <p class="light">Our different levels of service enable anyone to use the service -- from the poor in emerging economies (freemium), to the poor in the first world (basic model) to people anywhere who have succeeded despite skin color (premium model), but who could still use a hand up and some mentoring from those generous folk who have held power since the dawn of our glorious country. We offer a special discount (77% of the cost) on our basic and premium models for advice from a white woman.</p>

          <p class="light">Our innovative algorithm determines your skin color using our patented facial color recognition (™) software. Based on whether your skin is white or not, you’ll be guided through the process as a privilege deliverer (“Savior”) or privilege recipient (“Savee”).</p>

          <h5 class="center">Our Story</h5>

          <p class="light">Dmytri, Linda and Juan met on the Inca trail following the 2013 Latin American social innovation summit and soon realized that regardless of the continent, lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, just like was inequality. </p>
          <p class="light">After a weekend of post-it notes and cold brew coffee, WhiteSave.me was born. The team’s ah-ha moment came with the realization that the key to resolving inequality has nothing to do with revolution. Rather, it’s about “yes… and” thinking and re-imagining privilege as an infinite resource.</p>
          <p class="light">Everyone can share in privilege, and those with more privilege can be a part of delivering it to the less fortunate, using the world’s new-found mobile and digital connectivity as a strategic enabler. White people want to share their privilege -- and non-white people are waiting to receive it. They just haven’t had an app to help them do it!
