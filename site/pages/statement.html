    <p>We were brought together as a team through the Art-A-Hack initiative.</p>

    <p>Our project is “Imbalances in Tech.” We want to push people to reflect on digital saviorism, the danger of biased algorithms and binary approaches, the ridiculousness of simple solutions to complex deep-seated problems, and the folly that techno-utopian fixes can address issues like poverty, inequality and exclusion without addressing power imbalances and the entrenched historical privilege of certain individuals, institutions, and nations.</p>

    <p>To explore those topics, we chose to focus on a complex, historical, systemic and touchy issue – white privilege – because it is highlighted by and a strong driver of all of the above.</p>

    <p>We created a real/fake tech start-up with a business model, an app, a cheesy self-centered founders story, and everything else that a real start up aimed at “doing social good” typically has. We used the language bandied about by those in tech and social good – focusing our fake start up on ‘doing good while making a profit.’ We purposely centered our fake app on white people and their user experiences, and set it up so that non-white people would foot the bill.</p>

    <p>The app enables white man to ‘deliver privilege’ to the less privileged. We chose this language because ‘delivering privilege’ is just about as impossible as ‘delivering development’ or ‘delivering democracy’ through tech applications.</p>

    <p>In order for someone to participate in the WhiteSave.me experience, they need to first prove their qualifications to be a White Savior through the “whiteness detector,” which is based on a faulty algorithm that uses a video camera to determine whether a person is white or not white. The algorithm is both simplistic and biased. It’s also often wrong. Once the app determines if a person is white or not, the person is matched a White Savior or a non-white ‘Savee’. The White Savior provides privileged answers to the Savee’s lack-of-privilege-related questions through SMS, voice, video or in person (depending on how much the Savee is willing to pay).</p>

    <p>We created a satire because because satire can be deep and cutting, and it often makes people think while they laugh uncomfortably. We want people to look at this site and feel unsure if it’s real or not. We want people to feel uncomfortable with both imbalances in tech and white privilege. People of Color are normally well aware of the issues we highlight, but often White people shy away from talking about them or they talk about them in a way that puts whiteness at the center, reconfirming white privilege. Our site purposely puts white people at the center in a very over the top way, as commentary.</p>

    <p>Through the project, we highlight how technological quick fix solutions are Band Aids that do nothing to resolve deep historical and institutionalized inequalities and biases. Tech often serves to distract people from these deeper issues and potential longer-term changes that will necessarily touch issues of power and require change by those who hold power. Through the “white or not” algorithm, we show how tech, as a binary tool, does not do a good job with nuances and complex issues. And race is not binary, especially considering that biological race doesn’t even exist.</p>

    <p>From the start of the project, we’ve consulted and shared the project with a diverse group of advisors and testers (white and not white) for orientation, criticism, commentary and other feedback. The creation of the website and the fake app we were able to explore and comment on imbalances in tech and how they reflect the world’s wider imbalances in blatant ways as well as through subtler microaggressions.</p>

    <p>We are not against technology or against people helping, but we do think the use of technology in social good and social change needs to be deeply thought about. The so-called ‘solutions’ need to be complex and deep, and they need to address issues of power.</p>

    <p>We hope the project will generate discussion and reflection and we welcome and comments or feedback.</p>
