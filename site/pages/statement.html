    <p>We were brought together as a team through the <a href="http://artahack.io/">Art-A-Hack</a> initiative.</p>

    <p>Our project is “Imbalances in Tech.” We want to push people to reflect on digital saviorism, the danger of biased algorithms and binary approaches, the ridiculousness of simple solutions to complex deep-seated problems, and the folly that techno-utopian fixes can address issues like poverty, inequality and exclusion without addressing power imbalances and the entrenched historical privilege of certain individuals, institutions, and nations.</p>

    <p>To explore those topics, we chose to focus on a complex, historical, systemic and touchy issue – white privilege – because it is highlighted by and a strong driver of all of the above.</p>

    <p>We created a real/fake tech start-up with a business model, an app, a cheesy self-centered founders' story, and everything else that a real start up aimed at “doing social good” typically has. We used the language bandied about by those in tech and social good – focusing our fake start up on ‘doing good while making a profit.’ We purposely centered our fake app on white people and their user experiences, and set it up so that non-white people would foot the bill through both cash, data mining and targeted advertising.</p>

    <p>The app enables white men to ‘deliver privilege’ to the less privileged. We chose this language because ‘delivering privilege’ is just about as impossible as ‘delivering development’ or ‘delivering democracy’ through tech applications. We created a special discount for getting advice from white women - 77% of the price of a white man - to reflect the current pay gap between men and women.</p>-

    <p>In order for someone to participate in the WhiteSave.me experience, they need to first prove their qualification to be a White Savior through the “whiteness detector,” which is based on a faulty algorithm. It uses a video camera to determine whether a person is white or not white. The algorithm is both simplistic and biased. It’s also often wrong. Once the algorithm determines if a person is white or not, the person is matched with a 'White Savior' or a non-white ‘Savee’. The White Savior provides privileged answers to the Savee’s lack-of-privilege-related questions through SMS, voice, video or in person (depending on how much the Savee is willing to pay).</p>

    <p>We created a satire because because satire can be deep and cutting, and it often makes people think while they laugh nervously (or sometimes hysterically). We want people to look at this site and feel unsure if it’s real or not. We want people to feel uncomfortable with both imbalances in tech and with white privilege. We want some people to see themselves in the caricatures and reflect on the 'solutions' they design. People of Color are normally well aware of the issues we highlight, but often white people shy away from talking about them or they talk about them in a way that puts whiteness at the center, reconfirming white privilege. Our site purposely puts white people at the center in an over the top way, as commentary on this tendency. We also provide no real benefit to 'Savees.' We wanted to call out projects that are designed to make donors and volunteers feel good about themselves without actually making an impact on those who are supposedly benefiting from generosity and aid. The 'build it and they will come' model for Savees is also purposeful. All our outreach and the site itself is aimed at White Saviors, whereas the business model relies entirely on Savees' willingness to pay for a service that will not actually provide them with any benefit.</p>

    <p>Through the project, we highlight how technological quick fix solutions are Band Aids that do nothing to resolve deep historical and institutionalized inequalities and biases. Tech often serves to distract people from these deeper issues and potential longer-term changes that will necessarily touch issues of power and require change by and in those who hold power. Through the “white or not” algorithm, we show how tech, as a binary tool, does not do a good job with nuances and complex issues. We also use the algorithm to comment on the false idea that race is binary, or that it even biologically exists.</p>

    <p>From the start of the idea, we’ve consulted and shared the project with a diverse group of advisors and testers (white and not white) for orientation, criticism, commentary and other feedback. We felt this was especially important given that the three of us are white. We've taken the feedback and incorporated it into the site. We wanted to avoid offending People of Color, while we did want to call out white people of all political persuasions for overt and unconscious bias. One commenter pointed out our own white privilege in creating this site, saying that a person of color would seem too angry by creating a site like this. Others cautioned us about offending or shocking white people, or creating feelings of guilt and stress in them. One person suggested that we might be targeted and harmed by white supremacists. We hope that is not true. Through the creation of the website and the fake app, we were able to explore and comment on imbalances in tech and how they reflect the world’s wider imbalances in blatant ways as well as through subtler microaggressions. We welcome any additional feedback, especially in areas where our own overt or unconscious biases are showing in ways that we ignore.</p>

    <p>We are not against technology. We are not against people helping or providing mentorship. However, we do think the use of technology in social good and social change needs to be deeply thought about with a very critical eye. The so-called ‘solutions’ need to be complex and deep, and they need to address issues of power. Tech itself needs to be more diverse and inclusive, as does "do-gooding."</p>

    <p>We hope the project will generate discussion and reflection and we welcome and comments or feedback.</p>

      <p>We also note that we conceived and created WhiteSave.me with full autonomy. We received no funding or other type of benefit except for lunch, meeting space and moral support from the Art-a-Hack team and our fellow Art-a-Hackers during the four Mondays that we worked together. The organizations listed below have covered (or plan to provide support for) some of the costs to host and run WhiteSave.me. We take full responsibility for the project and its content. It does not represent the views of Art-A-Hack, any of Art-A-Hack's sponsors, or any of our individual employers past, present or future.</p>

              Evil Genius Publishing is a micro-publisher focused on the humanitarian aid industry. Our goal is to publish books that actual aid workers actually want to read (as opposed to the vast majority of what’s written for the aid world which is absurdly dry, dull, boring, verbose, over-written, pretentious, self-important, and otherwise inaccessible to mere mortals like most of us). We are also passionate about providing opportunity for those who otherwise lack access to “formal” publishing spaces, including local aid workers and the recipients of aid programs, commonly known as “beneficiaries.”

              The Telekommunist Manifesto is an exploration of class conflict and property, born from a realization of the primacy of economic capacity in social struggles. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of productive assets and their output. The interpretation here is always tethered to an understanding that wealth and power are intrinsically linked, and only through the for- mer can the latter be achieved. As a collective of intellectual workers, the work of Telekommunisten is very much rooted in the free software and free culture communities. However, a central premise of this Manifesto is that engaging in software development and the production of immaterial cultural works is not enough. The communization of immaterial property alone cannot change the distribution of material productive assets, and therefore cannot eliminate exploitation; only the self-organization of production by workers can.
