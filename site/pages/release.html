<p><a href="http://whitesave.me"><strong>White</strong>Save.me</a> is a revolutionary new platform that enables White Saviors to
deliver privilege to non-Whites whenever and wherever they need it with the
simple tap of a finger.</p>

<p>Today’s White guy is increasingly told “check your privilege.” He often asks
himself “What am I supposed to do about my privilege? It’s not my fault I was
born white! And really, I’m not a bad person!”</p>

<p>Until now, there has been no simple way for a White guy to be proactive in
addressing the issue of his privilege. He’s been told that he benefits from
biased institutions and that his privilege is related to historically
entrenched power structures. He’s told to be an ally but to not take the lead
from people of color. Unfortunately this is all very complex and time
consuming, and addressing privilege in this way is very hard work.</p>

<p>We can’t wait to fix this urgent problem. We need to address the issue of White
privilege now. Changing attitudes, institutions, policies and structures takes
too damn long! What’s more, we can’t expect White men or our current systems to
go through deep changes in order to address privilege and inequality at the
roots. What we can do is leapfrog over what could have meant decades of
grassroots social organizing, education, and behavior change by putting the
solution to White privilege directly into White men’s hands so that everyone
can get back to enjoying the American dream.</p>

<p><a href="http://whitesave.me"><strong>White</strong>Save.me</a> – an innovative solution that enables White men to quickly and
easily deliver privilege to the underprivileged, requiring only a few minutes
of downtime, at their discretion and convenience.</p>

<p>Though not everyone realizes it, White privilege affects a large number of
White people, regardless of their age or political persuasion. White liberals
generally agree that they are privileged, but most are simply tired of hearing
about it and having to deal with it. Conservative White men may feel that they
earned their privilege, but consider it possible to teach people of color about
deep-seated American values and traditions and the notion of personal
responsibility. All told, what most White people want is a simple, direct way
to address their privilege once and for all. Our research has confirmed that
most White people would be willing to spend a few minutes every now and then
sharing their privilege, as long as it does not require too much effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://whitesave.me"><strong>White</strong>Save.me</a> is a revolutionary and innovative way of addressing this issue.
(<a href="http://whitesave.me/#story">Read Our Story</a> here to learn more about our discovery moments!) We’ve designed
a simple web and mobile platform that enables White men to quickly and easily
deliver a little bit of their excess privilege to non-Whites, all through a
simple and streamlined digital  interface. Liberal Whites can address their
guilt and concern about their own privilege with the tap of a finger.
Conservatives can feel satisfied that they have passed along good values to
non-Whites. Libertarians can prove through direct digital action that tech can
resolve complex issues without government intervention and within a free
market. And non-White people of any economic status, all over the world, will
benefit from immediate access to White privilege directly through their
devices. Everyone wins – with no messy disruption of the status quo!</p>

share some of your good sense and privileged counsel with him or her, or
periodically alleviate your guilt by offering advice and a one-off session of
helping someone who is less privileged.</p>
