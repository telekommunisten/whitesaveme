            <p class="light"><strong>White</strong>Save.me founders Dmytri, Jake, and Lulu met while backpacking the Inca trail as part of the “Unnecessary Innovating in the Mountains” gathering in 2013. We soon realized that lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, as were inequality and lack of privilege for non-White people. Following a weekend of post-it notes, some experimental Ayahuasca, and lots of cold brew coffee, <strong>White</strong>Save.me was born. <p>
            <p class="light">Our ah-ha moment came while reading a Buzzfeed article (gifs FTW!) on 12 facts about White male privilege. Clearly the media has been unfair to focus so much on White male privilege. They've even created terms like "systemic bias" and "institutional racism" with the sole purpose of making White men feel guilty.<p>
            <p class="light">Anyone living in the 21st century knows that privilege has absolutely nothing to do with history, politics, biased laws, or institutions that favor White men. Like everything else these days, it has to do with digital connecting and sharing. Building solutions that place White guys at the center of delivering privilege directly to the less privileged all over the world will easily resolve inequality while simultaneously eliminating the need for government funded social programs, community development organizations and social justice movements! White guys want to share their privilege -- they just haven’t had an app to let them do it!<p>
						<p  class="light"><strong>White</strong>Save.me is the solution the world's been waiting for. A simple app that lets White guys take advantage of their down-time to deliver privilege to the underprivileged right through their devices. Our hundreds of <a href="#success">Success Stories</a> from Saviors and Savees all over the world prove that it’s working.</p>
