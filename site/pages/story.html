            <p class="light"><strong>White</strong>Save.me founders Juan, Dmytri and Linda met while backpacking the Inca trail as part of the “Unnecessary Innovating in the Mountains” gathering in 2013. They soon realized that regardless of the continent, lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, as were inequality and lack of privilege for non-White people. Following a weekend of post-it notes, some experimental Ayahuasca, and lots of cold brew coffee, <strong>White</strong>Save.me was born. <p>
            <p class="light">The team’s ah-ha moment came while taking a quick Facebook break and reading 12 facts about White male privilege. Some 40% of Whites (that’s almost 80 million!) in the US believe that non-Whites don’t get ahead because they are not as hard working and motivated as Whites. But it’s been hard up to now for White guys to explain to the rest of the population how to be privileged. Instead, they’ve been made to feel like they should apologize for their privilege, and as if their voices are not as valuable on this subject as those of non-Whites. <p>
            <p class="light">We soon found that <strong>White</strong>Save.me was the answer to our question: How might we resolve inequality? Not all White men are selfish with their privilege. And redistributing privilege equally to everyone in the world has nothing to do with revolution or ‘smashing the patriarchy’! (LOL!!) Rather, it’s about re-imagining privilege as an infinite resource and enabling White guys to use technology to take the lead in delivering their privilege to the less privileged all over the world! White guys want to share their privilege -- they just haven’t had an app to let them do it! <strong>White</strong>Save.me is the solution we’ve all been waiting for. A simple app that lets White guys take advantage of their down-time to deliver privilege to the underprivileged right through their devices. Our hundreds of Success Stories from Saviors and Savees all over the world show that it’s working.</p>

Our team’s unique “Stand Your Innovation Ground” approach (a.k.a. Innovate Now, Ask Questions Later) has proven both lucrative and widely appreciated by social do-gooders.</p></div>
