            <p class="light">The <strong>white</strong>save.me team met while backpacking on the Inca trail following the 2013 Latin American social innovation summit. They soon realized that regardless of the continent, lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, as was inequality. <p>
            <p class="light"> After a weekend of post-it notes and cold brew coffee, WhiteSave.me was born. The team’s ah-ha moment came with the realization that the key to resolving inequality has nothing to do with revolution. Rather, it’s about “yes… and” thinking and re-imagining privilege as an infinite resource. 
            <p class="light">Everyone can share in privilege, and those with more privilege can be a part of delivering it to the less fortunate, using the world’s new-found mobile and digital connectivity as a strategic enabler. White people want to share their privilege -- they just haven’t had an app to help them do it!
