            <p class="light"><strong>White</strong>Save.me founders Dmytri, Jake, and Lulu met while backpacking the Inca trail as part of the “Unnecessary Innovating in the Mountains” gathering in 2013. We soon realized that regardless of the continent, lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, as were inequality and lack of privilege for non-White people. Following a weekend of post-it notes, some experimental Ayahuasca, and lots of cold brew coffee, <strong>White</strong>Save.me was born. <p>
            <p class="light">Our ah-ha moment came while reading a Buzzfeed article (gifs FTW!) on 12 facts about White male privilege. Clearly the media has been unfair to focus so much on White male privilege. They've even created terms like "systemic bias" and "institutional racism" with the sole purpose of making White men feel guilty.<p>
            <p class="light">Anyone living in the 21st century knows that privilege has absolutley nothing to do with history, politics, biased laws, or institutions that favor white men. Like everything else these days, it has to do with digital connecting and sharing. If we just build solutions that help White guys to take the lead in delivering privilege to the less privileged all over the world, we can easily solve inequality and eliminate the need for big government all at the same time! White guys want to share their privilege -- they just haven’t had an app to let them do it!<p>
						<p  class="light"><strong>White</strong>Save.me is the solution we’ve all been waiting for. A simple app that lets White guys take advantage of their down-time to deliver privilege to the underprivileged right through their devices. Our hundreds of <a href="#success">Success Stories</a> from Saviors and Savees all over the world prove that it’s working.</p>

            <p class="light">Our fresh and extensive experience in marketing, innovative technology solutions, backpacking around, and the social good sector make us uniquely placed to extract the value of privilege from one target demographic and deliver it to another, all the while tapping into available revenue from small pockets of cash that the underprivileged currently have but don’t invest wisely.
Our team’s tried and true “Innovate Now, Ask Questions Later” approach has proven both lucrative and widely scalable by successful start-ups and entrenched tech billionaires cum faux do-gooders everywhere.</p></div>
