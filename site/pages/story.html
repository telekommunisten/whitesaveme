            <p class="light"><strong>White</strong>Save.me founders Dmytri, Jake, and Lulu met while backpacking the Inca trail as part of the “Unnecessary Innovating in the Mountains” gathering in 2013. They soon realized that regardless of the continent, lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, as were inequality and lack of privilege for non-White people. Following a weekend of post-it notes, some experimental Ayahuasca, and lots of cold brew coffee, <strong>White</strong>Save.me was born. <p>
            <p class="light">The team’s ah-ha moment came while taking a quick Facebook break and reading 12 facts about White male privilege. Some 40% of Whites (that’s almost 80 million!) in the US believe that non-Whites don’t get ahead because they are not as hard working and motivated as Whites. But it’s been hard up to now for White guys to explain to the rest of the population how to be privileged. Instead, they’ve been made to feel like they should apologize for their privilege, and as if their voices are not as valuable on this subject as those of non-Whites. <p>
            <p class="light">We soon found that <strong>White</strong>Save.me was the answer to our question: How might we resolve inequality? Not all White men are selfish with their privilege. And redistributing privilege equally to everyone in the world has nothing to do with revolution or ‘smashing the White patriarchy’! (LOL!!) Rather, it’s about re-imagining privilege as an infinite resource and enabling White guys to use technology to take the lead in delivering their privilege to the less privileged all over the world! White guys want to share their privilege -- they just haven’t had an app to let them do it! <strong>White</strong>Save.me is the solution we’ve all been waiting for. A simple app that lets White guys take advantage of their down-time to deliver privilege to the underprivileged right through their devices. Our hundreds of Success Stories from Saviors and Savees all over the world show that it’s working.</p>

                Evil Genius Publishing is a micro-publisher focused on the humanitarian aid industry. Our goal is to publish books that actual aid workers actually want to read (as opposed to the vast majority of what’s written for the aid world which is absurdly dry, dull, boring, verbose, over-written, pretentious, self-important, and otherwise inaccessible to mere mortals like most of us). We are also passionate about providing opportunity for those who otherwise lack access to “formal” publishing spaces, including local aid workers and the recipients of aid programs, commonly known as “beneficiaries.”

                The Telekommunist Manifesto is an exploration of class conflict and property, born from a realization of the primacy of economic capacity in social struggles. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of productive assets and their output. The interpretation here is always tethered to an understanding that wealth and power are intrinsically linked, and only through the for- mer can the latter be achieved. As a collective of intellectual workers, the work of Telekom- munisten is very much rooted in the free software and free culture communities. However, a central premise of this Manifesto is that engaging in software development and the produc- tion of immaterial cultural works is not enough. The communization of immaterial property alone cannot change the distribution of material productive assets, and therefore cannot eliminate exploitation; only the self-organization of production by workers can.

By leveraging trust that communities place in WAC we will work at large scale to encourage community members to contribute small amounts of their hard-earned income to access white privilege, thereby enabling individuals in poverty-stricken areas to move away from primitive community-based socio-economic models of development towards modern, consumer-based digital development and global economies.<br><br> If your non profit organization would like to help us reach the base of the pyramid so that we can extract small amounts of revenue at scale in parts of the world where both markets and governments have historically failed to ensure people’s basic human rights, please reach out to us via <a href="http://twitter.com/whitesaveme">Twitter</a> or <a href="#contact">email.</a>
