                <hr><h5>William, Val and Hunter met while backpacking on the Inca trail following the 2013 Latin American social innovation summit. They soon realized that regardless of the continent, lack of innovative thinking was a problem the world over, as was inequality.<br><br></h5><h5>After a weekend of post-it notes and cold brew coffee, WhiteSave.me was born.

Rather, it’s about “yes… and” thinking and re-imagining privilege as an infinite resource.<br><br></h5><h5>Everyone can share in privilege, and those with more privilege can be a part of delivering it to the less fortunate, using the world’s new-found mobile and digital connectivity as a strategic enabler. White people want to share their privilege -- they just haven’t had an app to help them do it! <a href="/#start/">Launch Beta App.</a>.</h5><p></p><p></p></div><p></p>
