                “It was really great delivering some privilege through <strong>White</strong>Save.me. I’ve always felt that these people just need to be more motivated and hardworking and they’ll get ahead. <br><br>When I read that only 1% of CEOs are Black, I made sure to do a little research on Mark Zuckerberg so I could talk to some of these inner city kids about him. He didn’t go to college and look at him now&mdash;it’s like he fast tracked it right to the top. So I got to thinking&mdash;if we just teach these kids to code, they’ll be starting companies in no time. Or they can go work in Silicon Valley. Heck, by the time these kids graduate from high school in a few years, those Left Coast geek types will probably be open to hiring Blacks for tech jobs. <br><br>Right now most of these kids have this fantasy that they’ll grow up to be famous rappers or ball players. It’s a lot more realistic to think about being the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates, because that requires a real skill - coding.”
               <br><br><em>Bill, age 52, helped inner-city kids see that becoming a billionaire through coding and entrepreneurship is a lot more realistic than doing it via professional sports or rap music.</em>

                “I had a job in tech but was hitting an invisible ceiling as a Latina. A friend told me about <strong>White</strong>Save.me’s Premium Model where you can get a personal White savior in the flesh. I signed up and got connected with Trevor. <br><br>Once everyone saw us hanging out during my lunch break, they started including us in their happy hour invitations. He advised me to read “Lean In” and hang a poster of Sheryl Sandberg near my desk. Trevor doesn’t know anything about tech, but he really enjoyed explaining how tech works and telling me how to behave so that upper management would notice I was in the room without feeling threatened by my capacities. He advised me to look less Latina, be sure I never seemed angry, and dress more conservatively so I wouldn’t be seen as too sexy to be taken seriously. He also told me to stop speaking Spanish to my family on the phone during work hours, and that worked wonders! <br><br>With Trevor’s help, I moved up in the company. I even got asked to head up my company’s “Diversity Working Group” this year! I couldn’t be more grateful to Trevor and WhiteSave.me!”

                “I got pregnant when I was 19 and really didn’t know what to do because the guy I was with left town. My mom already worked a lot and I didn’t think she could afford to help me take care of a baby. Luckily, a friend told me about <strong>White</strong>Save.me. <br><br>I was able to connect with Hunter on my cellphone. I started explaining my situation, and he immediately interrupted me and said to stop worrying so much. He explained that most of his feminist friends are really into having babies on their own, and it’s really not a big deal. They’d actually prefer to have their freedom and not get married. He also told me about this great app that helps you to track your monthly cycle. <br><br>It doesn’t matter if the Planned Parenthood clinics are shut down now, he said, tech allows women today to manage their fertility on their own. I think I’ll try it. If it works for Hunter’s friends, it should work for me!”

               “I was just chilling with my friends when somebody got the idea to go get some provisions. Nobody was around to drive us, so we decided to risk it and walk over to the store. We were just crossing the street when this cop came by and started hassling us for no reason. I had my phone with the <strong>White</strong>Save.me app on it. So I just tapped it to get hold of the next available White guy. <br><br>We ended up getting Bruce. He told us to be extra polite and allow the cops to stop and search us without a struggle even though we hadn’t done anything&mdash;after all we were a pack of Black kids just walking around without a legitimate destination, aside from going to the store to get food. He said we probably looked like typical thugs up to no good. Bruce told me to just put my hands up and let the cops see my phone with his face on the video, so they knew he was with us, and that I didn’t have a gun. Then he said to just hand my phone over and let him do the talking. <br><br>The thing about <strong>White</strong>Save.me is that it was like Bruce was right there. He talked to the cops and they let us go with a warning as long as we went back to the house and kept Bruce on the phone with us till we got there! It’s great having someone like Bruce with you! He really saved us.”

               “We were having trouble with our cassava and maize crops this year over here in Kabete, Kenya, due to a serious drought. The organization that comes by here regularly to snap photos of us, World Aid Corps, told us about a new project called <strong>White</strong>Save.me where subsistence farmers like us can get farming advice from White men in the United States through our mobile phones. <br><br>My brother and I pooled our money to cover the airtime costs to text in some questions about how to manage when there is a severe drought. We got some advice from Topher who’s living in New York City. He told us about some kind of plants that his eco-friendly community gardening group is experimenting with and which grow on the side of tall buildings. He suggested that perhaps we could do the same. <br><br>We don’t have tall buildings here, and it’s quite expensive and difficult to find this type of equipment which Topher mentioned. But we enjoyed greeting someone living in the United States and we wish him well.”

               “I was having trouble with my son who had gotten suspended several times for being late to middle school. I was really at a loss on what to do about this until I saw an ad for <strong>White</strong>Save.me on the bus home from my 3rd shift and decided to try it. <br><br> I got instantly connected with Jake, who suggested that I stop working 2 jobs and join the PTA to bond better with the teachers. Jake doesn’t have kids of his own, but he really enjoyed telling us how to raise ours. He also helped us understand that Black kids are more like adults than White kids. So James Junior really had no excuse for arriving late to school - he should take responsibility and get himself to school on his own whether we are home or still working, regardless of his age.  <br><br>Jake really helped us see that we just weren’t trying hard enough as parents and James Junior was slacking off. Jake’s a great mentor -- he even told me that he couldn’t believe how articulate I was for a Black guy!”</em>
