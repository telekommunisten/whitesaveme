                “It was really great delivering some privilege through <strong>White</strong>Save.me. I’ve always felt that these people just need to be more motivated and hardworking and they’ll get ahead. <br><br>When I read that only 1% of CEOs are Black, I made sure to do a little research on Mark Zuckerberg so I could talk to some of these inner city kids about him. I'm pretty sure he didn't finish college, and look at him now&mdash;he fast tracked it right to the top. So I got to thinking&mdash;if we just teach these kids to code, they’ll be starting companies in no time. Or they can go work in Silicon Valley. Heck, by the time these kids graduate from high school in a few years, those Left Coast hippies will probably be open to hiring Blacks for tech jobs. <br><br>Right now most of these kids have this fantasy that they’ll grow up to be famous rappers or ball players. It’s a lot more realistic to think about being the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates, because that requires a real skill - coding.”
               <br><br><em>Bill helped inner-city kids see that becoming a billionaire through coding and entrepreneurship is a lot more realistic than doing it via professional sports or rap music.</em>

                “ “I got connected up with Maria Luisa. She was having trouble moving up the ladder in the tech company she’s been at for a while. She kept saying it was hard for women to get ahead in tech but I’m pretty tired of that excuse. Tech companies put a lot of emphasis on how well employees fit in with the culture, and I could see that even though Maria Luisa knows her stuff, she just doesn’t seem like she knows how to hang. <br><br>I gave her some tips– like changing her name to Mary Louise, dressing more White, not speaking Spanish at work, 'leaning in' more, and mainly just chillaxing and not being so angry all the time! She was paying for the Premium Model of <strong>White</strong>Save.me so I just hopped in a Buber and went over to have lunch with her in person a few times. I think being seen with me really helped her out. They started inviting her to Happy Hour, and she finally got promoted last month. They also put her in charge of the company’s “Diversity Working Group!”

                “I got linked up with this 20 year old chick who had accidentally gotten pregnant and was kind of freaking out. She started giving me a sob story, but I stopped her right there -- she was really overthinking things. I have a ton of friends who are into having a kid on their own. They actually prefer it – it’s like a feminist statement or badge of honor or something. And this girl was really making such a big deal out of her situation. I was like it is what it is - just embrace it and get on with things!’ <br><br>Plus there are all these great apps out there now that help women track their cycles. I’m not sure why getting pregnant is even a ‘thing’ any more. Shanaya didn’t seem to think I understood her situation, and I had to repeat myself several times, but I figure she’s better off now for having heard a White male perspective on things. This all really comes down to personal choice. I felt really good giving her some orientation, and I’m guessing she’ll download one of those apps I recommended.”

               “I help out a lot on <strong>White</strong>Save.me, sharing privilege all over the place. I helped this one kid, Jayden, when he got stopped by the cops last week for walking around in his neighborhood. I told him to be extra polite and let the cops stop and search without a struggle. I mean, these were Black kids just walking around without a legitimate destination, aside from going to the store to get food -- they probably looked like thugs up to no good. <br><br>I told Jayden to immediately put his hands up and let the cops see his phone with my face on the video, so the cops could see that I was with him and he didn’t have a gun. Eventually I just had him hand his phone over and I talked the cops into letting him and his pals go with just a warning, as long as they went straight back to the house and kept me on the phone till they got there. If more kids had a better attitude and folks like me to accompany them, I think w'd see the end of this whole anti-cop thing.”

               “I gave privilege to a whole village in rural Kenya. They were having trouble with their cassava and maize crops over there because of drought. World Aid Corps has an innovative app called <strong>White</strong>Save.me, where subsistence farmers can get farming advice from White men in the United States through their mobile phones. It sounds a lot more interesting than the regular farming stuff that charities do. The community members just have to come up with the airtime costs to text in some questions and it goes through Google Translate. <br><br>It’s really pretty cool. Right after I signed up, I got a text from this farmer dude and so I told him about Ted Talk I saw about these cool hydroponic plants that grow on the sides of buildings. I’m not sure if it was relevant since they don’t have tall buildings in their part of Kenya, and I’m guessing they can’t get any of the equipment, plus it’s not really working very well here in Brooklyn, but I didn’t really know what else to suggest. I think they really felt better after talking with someone in the US though, and they sounded really motivated to find a way out of the drought situation now.

               “I was having trouble with my son who had gotten suspended several times for being late to middle school. I was really at a loss on what to do about this until I saw an ad for <strong>White</strong>Save.me on the bus home from my 3rd shift and decided to try it. <br><br> I got instantly connected with Jake, who suggested that I stop working 2 jobs and join the PTA to bond better with the teachers. Jake doesn’t have kids of his own, but he really enjoyed telling us how to raise ours. He also helped us understand that Black kids are more like adults than White kids. So James Junior really had no excuse for arriving late to school - he should take responsibility and get himself to school on his own whether we are home or still working, regardless of his age.  <br><br>Jake really helped us see that we just weren’t trying hard enough as parents and James Junior was slacking off. Jake’s a great mentor -- he even told me that he couldn’t believe how articulate I was for a Black guy!”
							<br><br><em>James, age 32, got valuable insight into parenting and stopped his son from being repeatedly suspended from middle school, all via our Basic Model where he tapped into Jake’s good sense.</em>
