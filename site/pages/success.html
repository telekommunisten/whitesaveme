                “It was really great delivering some privilege through <strong>White</strong>Save.me. I’ve always felt that these people just need to be more motivated and hardworking and they’ll get ahead. <br><br>When I read that only 1% of CEOs are Black, I made sure to do a little research on Mark Zuckerberg so I could talk to some of these inner city kids about him. I'm pretty sure he didn't finish college, and look at him now&mdash;he fast tracked it right to the top. So I got to thinking&mdash;if we just teach these kids to code, they’ll be starting companies in no time. Or they can go work in Silicon Valley. Heck, by the time these kids graduate from high school in a few years, those Left Coast hippies will probably be open to hiring Blacks for tech jobs. <br><br>Right now most of these kids have this fantasy that they’ll grow up to be famous rappers or ball players. It’s a lot more realistic to think about being the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates, because that requires a real skill - coding.”
               <br><br><em>Bill helped inner-city kids see that becoming a billionaire through coding and entrepreneurship is a lot more realistic than doing it via professional sports or rap music.</em>

                “I got connected up with Maria Luisa. She was having trouble moving up the ladder in the tech company she’s been at for a while. She kept saying it was hard for women to get ahead in tech but I’m pretty tired of that excuse. Tech companies put a lot of emphasis on how well employees fit in with the culture, and I could see that even though Maria Luisa knows her stuff, she just doesn’t seem like she knows how to hang. <br><br>I gave her some tips– like changing her name to Mary Louise, dressing more White, not speaking Spanish at work, 'leaning in' more, and mainly just chillaxing and not being so angry all the time! She was paying for the Premium Model of <strong>White</strong>Save.me so I just hopped in a Buber and went over to have lunch with her in person a few times. I think being seen with me really helped her out. They started inviting her to Happy Hour, and she finally got promoted last month. They also put her in charge of the company’s “Diversity Working Group!”

                “I linked with this 20 year old chick who had accidentally gotten pregnant and was kind of freaking out. She started giving me a sob story, but I stopped her right there -- she was really overthinking things. I have a ton of friends who are into having a kid on their own. They actually prefer it – it’s like a feminist statement or badge of honor or something. And this girl was seriously making a big deal out of her situation. I was like - 'Girl, just embrace it and get on with things!’ <br><br>Plus there are all these great apps out there now that help women track their cycles. I’m not sure why getting pregnant is even a ‘thing’ any more. Shanaya didn’t seem to think I understood her situation, and I had to repeat myself several times, but I figure she’s better off now for having heard a White male perspective on things. This all really comes down to personal choice. I felt really good giving her some orientation, and I’m guessing she’ll download one of those apps I recommended.”

               “I help out a lot on <strong>White</strong>Save.me, sharing privilege all over the place. Once I helped this kid, Jayden, when he got stopped by the cops for walking around in his neighborhood. I told him to be extra polite and let the cops stop and search without a struggle. I mean, these were Black kids walking around without a legitimate destination, aside from going to the store to get food -- they probably looked like thugs up to no good. <br><br>I told Jayden to get his hands up and let the cops see his phone with my face on the video, so they'd know I was with him and he didn’t have a gun. Eventually I had him hand his phone over and I talked the cops into letting him and his pals go with just a warning, as long as they went straight back to the house and kept me on the phone till they got there. If more of these kids had a good attitude and folks like me to accompany them, I really think w'd see the end of this whole anti-cop thing.”

               “I gave privilege to a whole village in rural Kenya. They were having trouble with their cassava and maize crops over there because of drought. I support this organization called World Aid Corps, and they partnered with <strong>White</strong>Save.me so that subsistence farmers can get agricultural advice from White Americans through their mobile phones. They just have to come up with enough money to text in some questions and it goes through Google Translate. It’s really pretty cool.   <br><br>Right after I signed up, I got a text from this farmer. I told him about a Ted Talk I saw about hydroponic plant systems that grow on the sides of buildings. The guy I was talking with said they don’t have tall buildings in their part of Kenya, and he was concerned about getting any of the equipment I mentioned. I helped him see that he was stuck in his old ways and that a little bit of determination and disruptive thinking can go a long way towards overcoming any obstacles. I think he really felt a lot more motivated to try to innovate something after talking with someone in the US.

               “I talked with this guy, James, whose son kept getting suspended for being late to middle school. He was really at a loss about how to handle it. I told him that first off, he should join the PTA so he could be more involved in his son's school. I don’t have kids of my own, but I'm pretty good at giving advice to people on how to raise them. <br><br> I also told James that it's important to take personal responsibility for things. I know from media reports that Black kids mature faster than White kids. So James Junior should be able to get himself to school on his own whether his parents are working two jobs or not. If you ask me, James and his wife are also avoiding personal responsibility for their kid's education by working so much and not being home.  <br><br>It's a pretty clear cut case of lack of responsibility all around. James disagreed with me, but I think he was just missing my point. I think if he reflects a little on it, he'll see I'm right.
							<br><br><em>John gave James, age 32, valuable insight into the importance of personal responsibility.</em>
