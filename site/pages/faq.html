                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>We just need momentary access to your webcam in order to determine whether you are white or not. Once we’ve determined that through our patented facial color recognition software the camera will turn off. We do not share any of the images that we collect.</p></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>Our patented innovative software determines what color you are based on a custom face recognition algorithm. This solution provides accurate reading every time for enhanced security and privacy. </p></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>While you may think you are white, computers and algorithms developed by those in the field of innovative technology are like more equipped to detect aspects of whiteness or non-whiteness then the average person.

                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>We are fans of Buzzfeed and other media sources that confirm white privilege is a “thing.” But we also know from attending start-up conferences and reviewing news stories emanating from Silicon Valley (and from studying our start-up heroes like Uber) that digital tools can save the world from inequalities and deliver privilege to those who don’t have it. This has been proven many times by presentations at start-up conferences and international development conferences.</p></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>We all know that women are only worth 77% of men, based on the average pay gap between women and men in the US, so it’s only fair that our services offer a discounted rate for advice from white women. </p></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="mdi-navigation-expand-more"></i> <h6>What makes you think that white men can offer worthwhile advice to non-white people?
</h6></div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>White people have been running the world for centuries and have a lot of experience doing things within the system -- they did set it up and make sure it worked for them exclusively, after all! It’s only logical that they have the inside scoop on how to succeed in that system. In addition, white man have been running the vast majority of US corporations, foundations, start-ups and nonprofit organizations,  so clearly they know how to create socio-economic change as well as how to develop underprivileged countries and neighborhoods. They’re specially equipped to determine where investments should go to enable non-white communities to thrive. And white men are not bad people - they really do want to help. Our app simply offers white men a way to do that directly, and for people of color to access white men directly for immediate help and support. </p></div>
