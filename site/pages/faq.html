                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>We are fans of Buzzfeed and other media sources that confirm white privilege is a “thing.” We also know that technology companies are almost exclusively run by white men, and tech companies rule the world, for the most part. But we also know from attending start-up conferences and reviewing news stories emanating from Silicon Valley (and from studying our start-up heroes like Uber’s Trevor Kalanick and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg) that digital tools created by these same technology companies can save the world from inequalities and deliver privilege to those who don’t have it all the while maximizing profits for these companies. This has been proven many times by presentations at start-up conferences and international development conferences.</p></div>

                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>We all know that women are only worth 77% of men, based on the average pay gap between women and men in the US, so it’s only fair that our services offer a discounted rate for advice from white women. </p></div>

</h6></div>
                    <div class="collapsible-body" style=""><p>White people have been running the world for centuries and have a lot of experience doing things within the system -- they did set it up and make sure it worked for them exclusively, after all! It’s only logical that they have the inside scoop on how to succeed in that system. In addition, white man have been running the vast majority of US corporations, foundations, start-ups and nonprofit organizations,  so clearly they know how to create socio-economic change as well as how to do projects that develop underprivileged countries and neighborhoods. They’re specially equipped to determine where investments should go to enable non-white communities to thrive. And white men are not bad people - they really do want to help. Our app simply offers white men a way to do that directly, and for people of color to access white men directly for immediate help and support.</p></div>

We will also not share data from our Premium users. We do share the data of our Basic and Freemium users so that we can be sure to provide useful targeted advertisements for products and services that will best meet their needs and purchasing habits. Big data analysis of the most common problems that our Savees face will enable us to seek investors and advertisers who can help us keep our services low in cost for those who need it the most all the while allowing corporations and small local businesses to prey on them so that we can make our app sustainable and profitable.</p></div>
