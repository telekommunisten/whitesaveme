    <h5>Why do you need access to my camera?</h5>
    <p class="light">We need access to your camera in order to determine whether you are white or not. Once we’ve determined your Whiteness (or non-Whiteness) through our patented facial color recognition software&#8482; you will be connected to a Savior or a Savee to begin your life-changing video chat. We do not share any of the images that we collect.</p>

    <h5>How does the White-not White algorithm work?</h5>
    <p class="light">Our patented innovative software determines what color you are based on a custom facial skintone recognition algorithm. This solution provides an highly accurate reading every time for enhanced security and privacy.</p>

    <h5>Why does it say I’m not White? I’m definitely White.</h5>
    <p class="light">While you may think you are not White, computers and algorithms developed by those in the field of innovative technology are likely more equipped to detect aspects of Whiteness or non-Whiteness then the average person. Sometimes mistakes happen, but this is not a problem for the majority and can be chalked up to minute errors in the code.</p>

    <h5>Why do you assume that White people have privilege?</h5>
    <p class="light">We are fans of Buzzfeed and other media sources that confirm White privilege is a “thing.” We also know that technology companies are almost exclusively run by White men, and tech companies rule the world, for the most part. But we also know from attending start-up conferences and reviewing news stories emanating from Silicon Valley (and from studying our start-up heroes like Uber’s Trevor Kalanick and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg) that digital tools created by these same technology companies can save the world from inequalities and deliver privilege to those who don’t have it all the while maximizing profits for these companies. This has been proven many times by presentations at start-up conferences and international development conferences.</p>

    <h5>Why is there a discount for advice from White women?</h5>
    <p class="light">We all know that women are only worth 77% of men, based on the average pay gap between women and men in the US, so it’s only fair that our services offer a discounted rate for advice from White women.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>What makes you think that White men can offer worthwhile advice to non-White people?</h5>
    <p class="light">White men have been running the world for centuries and have a lot of experience doing things within the system -- they did set it up and make sure it worked for them exclusively, after all! It’s only logical that they have the inside scoop on how to succeed in that system. In addition, White men run the vast majority of US corporations, foundations, start-ups and nonprofit organizations, so clearly they know how to create socio-economic change as well as how to do projects that develop underprivileged countries and neighborhoods. They’re specially equipped to determine where investments should go to enable non-White communities to thrive. And White men want to help. Our app simply offers them a way to do that directly, and for people of color to access White men directly for immediate guidance and support.</p>

    <h5>What do you do with my data? Do you share it?</h5>
    <p class="light">Don’t worry - if you are a White man and you volunteer your advice and share your privilege, the app is free for you, and we will not share any of your data with third parties. We will also not share data from our Premium users. We do share the data of our Basic and Freemium users so that we can be sure to provide useful targeted advertisements for products and services that will best meet their needs and purchasing habits. Big data analysis of the most common problems that our Savees face will enable us to seek investors and advertisers who can help us keep our services low in cost for those who need it the most all the while allowing corporations and small local businesses to prey on them so that we can make our app sustainable and profitable.</p>

    <h5>Is this site for real?</h5>
    <p class="light">We hope it's clear that this site is satire. It aims to make people reflect on White privilege, digital saviorism, the danger of biased algorithms, the ridiculousness of simple solutions to deep-seated problems, and the folly that techno-utopian fixes can address issues like inequality and exclusion without addressing power imbalances and the entrenched historical privilege of certain individuals, institutions, and nations. Many thanks to <a href="http://artahack.io/">Art-A-Hack</a> for their interest in the idea and to our (White and non-White!) advisory board for their orientation, comments, suggestions and input on the site!</p>
