              Delivering kittens to the workplace and partnering with multilateral organizations to support women's empowerment was one thing, but Buber was looking to help out in a way that would really make a difference while also improving the company's reputation. Buber and <strong>White</strong>Save.me, have partnered up to process Savee support requests through Buber’s patented disruptive transportation system and deliver Saviors in the flesh to the underprivileged, who can track the location of their savior while they wait. (Premium Plan required. NYC pilot, pending global expansion).

            <span class="black-text"> Non profit partners are eager to
              develop public-private partnerships, use technology, and link
              with social enterprises in order to appear innovative. Our non
              profit champion, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorldAidCorps">World Aid Corps,</a>
              brings us access to the global base of the underprivileged
              pyramid, where rapid scale at minimal cost enables quick growth
              and revenue for our investors and shareholders.<br><br> By
              leveraging trust that communities place in WAC we will work at
              large scale to encourage community members to contribute small
              amounts of their hard-earned income to access white privilege,
              thereby enabling individuals in poverty-stricken areas to move
              away from primitive community-based socio-economic models of
              development towards modern, consumer-based digital development
              and global economies.<br><br> If your non profit organization
              would like to help us reach the base of the pyramid so that we
              can extract small amounts of revenue at scale in parts of the
              world where both markets and governments have historically
              failed to ensure people’s basic human rights, please reach out
