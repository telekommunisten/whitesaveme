                Delivering kittens to the workplace and partnering with multilateral organizations to support women's empowerment was one thing, but Boober was looking to help out in a way that would really make a difference while also improving our company's reputation. Boober and <strong>White</strong>Save.me, will process Savee support requests through Boober’s patented disruptive transportation system and deliver Saviors in the flesh to the underprivileged, who can track the location of their savior while they wait. (Premium Plan required. NYC pilot, pending global expansion).

                Non profit partners are eager to develop public-private partnerships, use technology, and link with social enterprises in order to appear innovative. Our non profit champion, <a href= https://www.facebook.com/WorldAidCorps>World Aid Corps,</a> brings us access to the global base of the underprivileged pyramid, where rapid scale at minimal cost enables quick growth and revenue for our investors and shareholders.<br><br>
By leveraging trust that communities place in WAC we will work at large scale to encourage community members to contribute small amounts of their hard-earned income to access white privilege, thereby enabling individuals in poverty-stricken areas to move away from primitive community-based socio-economic models of development towards modern, consumer-based digital development and global economies.<br><br> If your non profit organization would like to help us reach the base of the pyramid so that we can extract small amounts of revenue at scale in parts of the world where both markets and governments have historically failed to ensure people’s basic human rights, please reach out to us via <a href="http://twitter.com/whitesaveme">Twitter</a> or <a href="#contact">email.</a>

                Evil Genius Publishing is a micro-publisher focused on the humanitarian aid industry. Our goal is to publish books that actual aid workers actually want to read (as opposed to the vast majority of what’s written for the aid world which is absurdly dry, dull, boring, verbose, over-written, pretentious, self-important, and otherwise inaccessible to mere mortals like most of us). We are also passionate about providing opportunity for those who otherwise lack access to “formal” publishing spaces, including local aid workers and the recipients of aid programs, commonly known as “beneficiaries.”

                The Telekommunist Manifesto is an exploration of class conflict and property, born from a realization of the primacy of economic capacity in social struggles. Emphasis is placed on the distribution of productive assets and their output. The interpretation here is always tethered to an understanding that wealth and power are intrinsically linked, and only through the for- mer can the latter be achieved. As a collective of intellectual workers, the work of Telekom- munisten is very much rooted in the free software and free culture communities. However, a central premise of this Manifesto is that engaging in software development and the produc- tion of immaterial cultural works is not enough. The communization of immaterial property alone cannot change the distribution of material productive assets, and therefore cannot eliminate exploitation; only the self-organization of production by workers can.
