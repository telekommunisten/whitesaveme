    <h5>STEP 1: Click on <a href="http://whitesave.me/#try"><strong>Try it now!</a><strong> and get ready to chat!</h5>
    <p class="light">This will launch the <strong>White</strong>Save.me app and your web cam.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>STEP 2: Turn on your camera!</h5>
    <p class="light">Allow <strong>White</strong>Save.me to access your device’s camera. (Note, we do not store your information. See our <a href="#faq">FAQs</a> for more information on our privacy policies, aimed at protecting White Saviors and Premium Model customers).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>STEP 3: Determining Whiteness.</h5>
     <p class="light">The camera will start, and our patented “White or Not White” facial color detection software&trade;will determine your Whiteness. (Visit our <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> page if you do not agree with the results).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>STEP 4: Get matched! Start giving or getting privilege!</h5>
    <p class="light">Based on your results, we will automatically match you via video chat with a partner to begin delivering privilege (if you are White) or accessing privilege (if you are Not White).<br><br>
Savees can ask for the help they need for their particular situation, and Saviors provide their special White insights on how to resolve lack of privilege in ways that avoid uncomfortable discussions, protest, revolution or violence of any kind.<br><br>
<strong>White</strong>Save.me goes further than a “like” and delivers real results without any messy disrupting of the status quo. What’s more, it doesn’t require much effort or long-term interest from anyone! Once the chat is over, Saviors are free to stop caring, knowing they’ve done their bit, and Savee problems will be fixed and they can get on with their lives.<br><br>
End your chat at any time. If a problem is beyond a Savior’s capacity to resolve or a Savee has already gotten the same advice from a different Savior, just move to the next person or end the chat session altogether.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="divider"></div>
  <div class="section">
    <h5>STEP 5: Rate your experience.</h5>
    <p class="light">As a Savee, you can give your Savior 1 to 5 “Savior Stars” based on the quality of his (or her if you are using the discounted model) advice. Saviors can reward Savees with “Savee Stars” based on the worthiness of their problems and how likely the Savior thinks it is that the Savee will work hard and be motivated to resolve them.</p>

    <h5>STEP 6: Sign up for the pricing model that’s best for you and download the app!</h5>
   <p class="light">Following your session, decide whether the Free, Basic or Premium Model is best for you, and create your account. If you are accessing from our list of Third World Countries, we will automatically sign you up for the Free model, based on your location.</p>

                <p>For our least privileged users (Savees) in the Third World, we offer an SMS-based Freemium model.<br><br>
We know that many of our least privileged users cannot speak English, but our solution integrates Google Translate, enabling Saviors and Savees to easily converse via SMS to share problems and expert privileged advice despite any global language, culture or life experience barriers.<br><br>
Working through our Non Profit Champion, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorldAidCorps">World Aid Corps</a>, we will engage with the most excluded people in the most far off places of the Third World. That enables us to reach those who have the biggest problems. SMS provides us a quick and easy way to reach our beneficiaries in any language. After all, there are more mobile phones than toilets now, according to the World Bank, so reaching the poorest of the poor is no longer an issue! <br><br>
Our White Saviors will be able to provide their life-saving advice and deliver privilege with the touch of a button! Ending global poverty and lack of White privilege has never been so easy.<br><br>

				<span class="card-title black-text">BASIC</span>
                <p>Our Basic Model is designed for those Savees who are not privileged themselves, but who are surrounded by the vast privilege of others, especially White privilege. These are the Savees who don’t know how to access White Saviors or who perhaps feel ashamed to admit publicly that they need saving.<br><br>
Basic users (Savees) pay a small fee to access a White Savior via SMS, video chat or voice. Say a non-White person is being pulled over by the police and needs some quick advice on how to avoid being shot, beaten or choked to death. A quick click launches the app, and the non-White Savee can access any available White Savior, who will provide advice on the right attitude and the best way to leave the situation alive and unharmed. <br><br>
In dire situations, Basic users can quickly upgrade to the Premium Model and have a White Savior delivered to them in person to serve as an intermediary, a witness, a role model or to otherwise accompany them.<br><br>
The app works best on Android phones. Our Skype API allows us to provide service in multiple languages.<br><br>
Video chat allows the Savee to hand the phone over to an authority figure for White Savior intermediation services. <a href="http://whitesave.me/#try"><strong>Try it now and your first session is free!</a><strong>

				<span class="card-title black-text">PREMIUM</span>
                <p>Even successful non-White people need a hand at some point. Our premium service is for the non-White Savee who has ‘made it,’ but still needs a White Savior to intervene for them from time to time or to offer personal one-on-one advice and mentorship.<br><br>
                Say a non-White Savee is up for a promotion and wonders if race will be a factor. As a Premium Model Savee, he or she can call on a White Savior to accompany him or her out for drinks with the boss, join a high level meeting in person, or simply put in a good word and offer a strong handshake (no ‘terrorist fist bumping’ allowed here! LOL) and a few slaps on the back to those in charge.<br><br>

A White Savior is also useful for non-White female Savees who Women often need someone to Whitemansplain what their superiors are saying so that they can grasp the true meaning in White man terms. The Premium Model allows for White mansplaining in real-time through almost any channel, including in person (Mansplaining not available with our ‘Advice from a White Woman’ discount).<br><br>
In an emergency situation, our Premium Model customers can request a White Savior who will arrive directly to them. Using Boober’s patented disruptive transportation model and based on their highly successful kitten delivery service, we’ll ensure that the White Savior who is geographically closest to the Savee will arrive quickly. Using geolocation, the Savee can track the Savior’s location and arrival right on the device for easy and safe identification.<a href="http://whitesave.me/#try"><strong>Try it now and your first video session is free!</a><strong>
