          <p class="light">Our beta version connects a White Savior and a Savee via video chat. It’s simple, easy, and impactful. What’s more, your first session is free if you <a href="http://whitesave.me/#call"><strong>try it now!</strong></a></p>

      <h6>Just follow these 6 steps and you’re on your way to delivering or accessing privilege!</h6>

      <div class="section">
        <h5>STEP 1: Click on <a href="http://whitesave.me/#call"><strong>Try it now!</strong></a> and get ready to chat!</h5>
        <p class="light">This will launch the <strong>White</strong>Save.me app and your web cam. Make sure your lighting is adequate so that the <strong>White</strong>Save.me algorithm can correctly determine your Whiteness (avoid backlighting and extremely dim rooms). By clicking <a href="http://whitesave.me/#call">here</a> to start your session, you are agreeing with our <a href="#terms">terms and conditions.</a><br>

      <div class="section">
        <h5>STEP 2: Turn on your camera!</h5>
        <p class="light">Allow <strong>White</strong>Save.me to access your device’s camera. (See our <a href="#faq">FAQs</a> for our privacy policy, aimed at protecting White Saviors and Premium Model customers).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <h5>STEP 3: Determining Whiteness.</h5>
        <p class="light">The camera will start, and our patented “White or Not White” facial color detection software&trade; will determine your Whiteness. (Visit our <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> page if you do not agree with the results).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <h5>STEP 4: Get matched! Start giving or getting privilege!</h5>
        <p class="light">Based on your results, we will automatically match you via video chat with a partner to begin delivering privilege (if you are White) or accessing privilege (if you are Not White).<br><br>
        Savees can ask for help and Saviors provide special White insight on how to resolve lack of privilege in ways that avoid uncomfortable discussions, protests, or the possibility of a revolution. <strong>White</strong>Save.me goes further than a “like” and delivers real results without disrupting the status quo.<br><br>
        End your chat at any time. If a Savior gets bored trying to resolve a problem or realizes it's beyond his capacity or a Savee has already gotten the same advice from a different Savior, just move to the next person or end the chat session altogether.</p>

      <div class="divider"></div>
      <div class="section">
        <h5>STEP 5: Rate your experience.</h5>
        <p class="light">As a Savee, you can give your Savior 1 to 5 “Savior Stars” based on the quality of advice. Saviors can reward Savees with “Savee Stars” based on the worthiness of their problems and how likely it seems that the Savee will work hard and be motivated.</p>

        <h5>STEP 6: Sign up for the pricing model that’s best for you and download the app!</h5>
        <p class="light">Following your session, decide whether the <a href="#pricing"> Free, Basic or Premium Model </a> is best for you, and create your account. If you are accessing from our list of Third World Countries, we will automatically sign you up for the Free model, based on your location.</p>
