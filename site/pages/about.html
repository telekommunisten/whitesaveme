                <p>For our least privileged users (Savees) in the Third World, we offer an SMS-based Freemium model.<br><br>
									We know that many of our least privileged users cannot speak English, but our solution integrates Google Translate, enabling Saviors and Savees to easily converse via SMS to share problems and expert privileged advice despite any global language, culture or life experience barriers.
<br><br>
Working through our Non Profit Champion, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorldAidCorps">World Aid Corps</a>, wwe will engage with the most excluded people in the most far off places. That enables us to reach those people who have the biggest problems. SMS provides us a quick and easy way to reach these beneficiaries in any language. After all, there are more mobile phones than toilets now, according to the World Bank, so reaching the poorest of the poor is no longer an issue!
 <br><br>
Our White Saviors will be able to provide their life-saving advice and deliver privilege with the touch of a button! Ending global poverty and lack of White privilege has never been so easy.

				<span class="card-title black-text">BASIC</span>
                <p>Our Basic Model is designed for those Savees who are not privileged themselves, but who are surrounded by the vast privilege of others, especially White privilege. These are the Savees who don’t know how to access White Saviors or who perhaps feel ashamed to admit publicly that they need saving.
<br><br>
Basic users (Savees) pay a small fee to access a White Savior via SMS, video chat or voice. Say a non-White person is being pulled over by the police and needs some quick advice on how to avoid being shot, beaten or choked to death. A quick click launches the app, and the non-White Savee can access any available White Savior, who will provide advice on the right attitude and the best way to leave the situation alive and unharmed.
 <br><br>
In dire situations, Basic users can quickly upgrade to the Premium Model and have a White Savior delivered to them in person to serve as an intermediary, a witness, a role model or to otherwise accompany them.
<br><br>
The app works best on Android phones. Our Skype API allows us to provide service in multiple languages.
<br><br>
Video chat allows the Savee to hand the phone over to an authority figure for White Savior intermediation services.

                <p>Even successful non-White people need a hand at some point. Our premium service is for the non-White Savee who has ‘made it,’ but still needs a White Savior to intervene for them from time to time or to offer personal one-on-one advice and mentorship.<br><br>
									Say a non-White Savee is up for a promotion and wonders if race will be a factor. As a Premium Model Savee, he or she can call on a White Savior to accompany him or her out for drinks with the boss, join a high level meeting in person, or simply put in a good word and offer a strong handshake (no ‘terrorist fist bumping’ allowed here! LOL) and a few slaps on the back to those in charge.
<br><br>

A White Savior is also useful for non-White female Savees who Women often need someone to Whitemansplain what their superiors are saying so that they can grasp the true meaning in White man terms. The Premium Model allows for White mansplaining in real-time through almost any channel, including in person (Mansplaining not available with our ‘Advice from a White Woman’ discount).
<br><br>
In an emergency situation, our Premium Model customers can request a White Savior who will arrive directly to them. Using Boober’s patented disruptive transportation model and based on their highly successful kitten delivery service, we’ll ensure that the White Savior who is geographically closest to the Savee will arrive quickly. Using geolocation, the Savee can track the Savior’s location and arrival right on the device for easy and safe identification.<br><br>

                “I was having trouble with my son who had gotten suspended several times for being late to middle school. Sometimes his mom and I aren’t home to get him up for school in the morning ‘cause we work a lot. I was really at a loss on what to do about this until I saw an ad for <strong>White</strong>Save.me on the bus home from my 3rd shift and decided to try it. <br><br> I got instantly hooked up with Jake, who suggested that I stop working 2 jobs and join the PTA to bond better with the teachers. Now, Jake doesn’t have kids of his own, but he really enjoyed telling us how to raise ours. He also helped us understand that, from a very young age, Black kids are more like adults than White kids are. So James Junior really had no excuse for arriving late to school - he should take responsibility and get himself to school on his own whether we are home or not, regardless of his age. Black kids are just more streetwise and mature like that, Jake said. <br><br>He really helped us see that we just weren’t trying hard enough as parents and James Junior was slacking off. Jake’s a great mentor -- he even told me that he couldn’t believe how articulate I was for a Black guy!”

A friend told me about <strong>White</strong>Save.me’s Premium Model where you can get a personal white savior, in the flesh. I signed up and got connected with Trevor. <br><br>Once everyone saw me hanging out with him during my lunch break, they started including us in their happy hour drink invitations. He advised me to read “Lean In” so I’d fit in better, and got me a poster of Sheryl Sandberg to keep right by my desk. Trevor doesn’t really know much about tech, but he really enjoyed explaining how tech works and telling me how to behave so that upper management would notice that I was in the room without feeling threatened by my capacities. He advised me to try to look less Latina and to dress more conservatively so that I wouldn’t be seen as too sexy to be taken seriously. He also told me to stop speaking Spanish to my family on the phone during work hours, and that really worked wonders! <br><br>With Trevor’s help, I was able to move up in the company. I even got asked to head up my company’s “Diversity Working Group” this year! I couldn’t be more grateful to Trevor and WhiteSave.me!”

He also told me about this great app that helps you to track your monthly cycle. <br><br>It doesn’t matter if the Planned Parenthood clinics are shut down now, he said, tech allows women today to manage their fertility on their own.

He said we probably looked like typical thugs up to no good, and we should just accept that. Bruce told me to just put my hands up and let the cops see my phone with his face on the video, so they knew he was with us, and that we didn’t have a gun. Then he said to just hand my phone over and let him do the talking. <br><br>The dope thing about <strong>White</strong>Save.me is that it was like Bruce was right there.

               “It was really great delivering some privilege through <strong>White</strong>Save.me. I’ve always felt that these people just need to be more motivated and hardworking and they’ll get ahead. <br><br>When I read that only 1% of CEOs are Black, I made sure to do a little research on Mark Zuckerberg so I could talk to some of these inner city kids about him. He didn’t go to college and look at him now&mdash;it’s like he fast tracked it right to the top. So I got to thinking&mdash;if we just teach these kids to code, they’ll be starting companies in no time. Or they can go work in Silicon Valley. Heck, by the time these kids graduate from high school in a few years, those Left Coast geek types will probably be open to hiring Blacks for tech jobs. <br><br>Right now most of these kids have this fantasy that they’ll grow up to be famous rappers or ball players. It’s a lot more realistic to think about being the next Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates, because that requires a real skill - coding.”
