                <hr><h5>Our app taps into whites’ desire to help people of color learn to be more hard working and motivated. 	</h5>
               	<p class="light">Our innovative solution uses tech to expand and deliver privilege where it’s needed most&mdash;and everyone wins! White men earn “Savior Stars” for providing free expert advice and mentoring from their unique perspective as long-standing privilege holders. </p>
          		<p class="light">Non-whites access white privilege and use white advice, knowledge and skills to their advantage. They earn “Savee Stars” based on the worthiness of their problems and their work and motivation to resolve them.</p>

            <p class="light">Our different levels of service enable anyone to use the service&mdash;from the poor in emerging economies (freemium), to the poor in the first world (basic model) to people anywhere who have succeeded despite skin color (premium model), but who could still use a hand up and some mentoring from those generous folk who have held power since the dawn of our glorious country. We offer a special discount (77% of the cost) on our basic and premium models for advice from a white woman.</p>

				<span class="card-title black-text">FREEMIUM</span>
                <p>For our least privileged users, we offer an SMS-based Freemium model.<br><br>
We know that many of our least privileged users will not speak English, but our solution integrates Google Translate, enabling Saviors and Savees to easily converse via SMS to share problems and expert privileged advice despite any global language, culture or life experience barriers.<br><br>
Working through our Non Profit Champion, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorldAidCorps">World Aid Corps</a>, we will engage with the most excluded people in the most far off places. That enables us to reach those people who have with the biggest problems. SMS provides us a quick and easy way to reach these beneficiaries in any language. After all, there are more mobile phones than toilets now, according to the World Bank, so reaching the poorest of the poor is no longer an issue! <br><br>
Our white saviors will be able to provide their life-saving advice and deliver privilege with the touch of a button! Ending global poverty and ending lack of privilege has never been so easy.<br><br>

				<span class="card-title black-text">BASIC</span>
                <p>Our Basic service is designed for those who are not privileged themselves yet who are surrounded by the vast privilege of others, especially white privilege.<br><br>
Basic users pay a small fee to access white savior advice via SMS, video chat or voice. Say a non-white person being pulled over by the police and needs some quick advice on how to avoid being shot, beaten or choked to death. A quick click to start up the app and the non-white person can access any available white savior. He will provide advice on the right attitude and the best way to leave the situation alive and unharmed. <br><br>
In dire situations, basic users can quickly upgrade to Premium and have a white savior delivered to them in person to serve as an intermediary or witness.<br><br>
Our Skype API means that this service is available in multiple languages.<br><br> 
Video chat allows the user to hand the phone over to an authority figure for white savior intermediation services.<br><br>

                <p>The premium service is for the non-white person who has made it, but still needs a white savior who can intervene or offer one-on-one advice and mentorship.<br><br> 
                Even successful non-white people need a hand at some point.<br><br>
                
When there’s a promotion to be had, a Premium user can call on a white savior to accompany him or her to a meeting to put in a good word. <br><br>
Women often need someone to whitemansplain what their superiors are saying so that they can grasp the true meaning in white man terms.<br><br>
In an emergency situation, our Premium customers can request a white savior who will arrive directly to them. Using Uber’s patented business model and based on their kitten delivery service, we’ll ensure that the white savior that is closest to you will arrive quickly. You can track his arrival right on your phone for easy identification.<br><br>
<strong>All for $29/month.</strong>
