                <p class="light">For our least privileged users (Savees) in the Third World, we offer an SMS-based Freemium model.<br><br>
                We know that many of our least privileged users cannot speak English, so our solution integrates Google Translate, enabling Saviors and Savees to easily converse via SMS to share problems and expert privileged advice despite any global language, culture or life experience barriers.<br><br>
                Working through our Non Profit Champion, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorldAidCorps">World Aid Corps</a>, we will engage with the most excluded people in the most far off places of the Third World. That enables us to reach those who have the biggest problems and the least capacity to resolve them. SMS provides us a quick and easy way to reach our beneficiaries in any language. After all, there are more mobile phones than toilets now, according to the World Bank, so reaching the poorest of the poor is no longer an issue! <br><br>
                Our White Saviors will be able to provide their life-saving advice and deliver privilege with the touch of a button! Ending global poverty and lack of White privilege has never been so quick and easy.<br><br>

                <p class="light">Our Basic Model is designed for those Savees who are not privileged themselves, but who are surrounded by the privilege of others. <br><br>
                Basic users (Savees) pay a small fee to access a White Savior via SMS, video chat or voice. Say a non-White person is being pulled over by the police and needs some rapid advice on how to avoid being shot, beaten or choked to death. A quick click launches the app, and the non-White Savee can access any available White Savior, who will provide tips on the right attitude and the best way to leave the situation alive and unharmed. <br><br>
                In dire situations, Basic users can quickly upgrade to the Premium Model and have a White Savior delivered to them in person to serve as an intermediary, a witness, a role model or to otherwise accompany them.<br><br>
                The app works best on Android phones. Our Skype API allows us to provide service in multiple languages.<br><br>
                Video chat allows the Savee to hand the phone over to an authority figure for White Savior intermediation services. <a href="http://whitesave.me/#call"><strong>Try it now and your first session is free!</strong></a>

                <p class="light">Even successful non-White people need a hand at some point. Our premium service is for the non-White Savee who has ‘made it,’ but still needs personal advice or White Savior intervention from time-to-time.<br><br>
                Say a non-White Savee is up for a promotion and wonders if race will be a factor. As a Premium Model Savee, he or she can call on a White Savior to personally accompany him or her out for drinks with the boss, join a high level meeting, or simply put in a good word and offer a strong handshake (no ‘terrorist fist bumping’ allowed here! LOL) and a few slaps on the back to those in charge.<br><br>

                A White Savior is also useful for non-White female Savees who need someone to mansplain what their superiors are saying. The Premium Model allows for White mansplaining in real-time through almost any channel, including in person (Mansplaining not available with our ‘Advice from a White Woman’ discount).<br><br>
                In an emergency situation, Premium Model customers can request a White Savior who will arrive directly to them. Using <a href="http://whitesave.me/#partners">Buber's</a> patented disruptive transportation model and based on their highly successful kitten delivery service, we’ll ensure that the White Savior who is closest to the Savee will arrive quickly. Using geolocation, the Savee can track the Savior’s location and arrival time right on the device.<a href="http://whitesave.me/#call"><strong>Try it now and your first session is free!</strong></a>
